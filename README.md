# 🧮 Numerical Analysis in C

This repository contains all the **Numerical Analysis programs** I implemented during my graduation.  
Each folder includes a **specific method or algorithm**, written in **C language**, to solve mathematical or computational problems numerically.

## 📁 Folder Structure

| Folder Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `Bisection Method` | Implements the Bisection method for solving nonlinear equations. |
| `NewtonRaphson` | Uses Newton-Raphson iteration to find roots of equations. |
| `GaussElimination` | Performs Gaussian Elimination for solving linear systems. |
| `Euler's Method` | Numerical solution of differential equations using Euler’s method. | ........

> 📌 Each folder contains a `main.c` file with comments explaining the logic and mathematical steps.
